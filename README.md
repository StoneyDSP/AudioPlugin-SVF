Simple Multi-Mode State Variable Filter using TPT, built directly from the StoneyDSP AudioPlugin template repository

# Built-in features:
+ variable oversampling up to 16x
+ variable processing precision (floats or doubles)
+ dry/wet mix with optional latency compensation
+ master output gain for "wet" signal
+ local context bypass switch
+ master bypass switch
+ defeatable GUI (requires window close/re-open)
+ de-coupled processing and true-bypass of audio processors in a lock-free atomic structure

# Manual - v1.0.0b

+ IO - Toggles the filter band on or off.
+ Frequency - Sets the centre frequency of the equalizer filter.
+ Resonance - Increases the amount of "emphasis" of the corner frequency
+ Type* - Chooses the type of filter to use. See below for more.
+ Oversampling - Increasing the oversampling will improve performance at high frequencies - at the cost of more CPU!
+ Mix - Blend between the filter affect (100%) and the dry signal (0%).
+ Precision - Switch between Float precision (High Quality) and Double precision (beyond High Quality) in the audio path
+ Bypass - Toggles the entire plugin on or off.
+ GUI - Toggles between a generic, automated GUI arrangement, or the custom one defined in the Editor files (requires window close/re-open)
